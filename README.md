CS 370 Module Eight Journal: Pirate Intelligent Agent
For this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using deep Q-learning to navigate a maze and find treasure. The goal was to train the AI to optimize its path over time using reinforcement learning. I was given starter code that included the environment setup (TreasureMaze.py) and experience replay functionality (GameExperience.py). My main task was to implement the Q-training algorithm, which allowed the pirate to learn through trial and error by balancing exploration and exploitation.

Connecting My Learning to Computer Science
This project helped me understand how reinforcement learning fits into the larger field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Computer scientists build systems that can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make intelligent decisions—all of which were key aspects of this project. AI is used in fields like robotics, finance, and healthcare, and working with deep Q-learning showed me how complex decision-making can be automated.

One of the biggest takeaways from this course was learning how to approach problems like a computer scientist. Instead of looking for a single, immediate solution, I had to think in terms of algorithms, training processes, and iterative improvements. Debugging the AI’s performance was also a key part of the process, reinforcing the idea that problem-solving in computer science is rarely a one-step process.

Ethical Responsibilities in AI
This project also made me think more about the ethical responsibilities of AI development. Reinforcement learning models are only as good as the data they learn from, meaning biases or errors in training can lead to flawed decision-making. In real-world applications, AI needs to be transparent and fair, especially when making decisions that impact users. Privacy is another big concern, especially when AI systems collect data from users. As a developer, it's important to design AI that is both effective and responsible.

This project gave me hands-on experience with reinforcement learning and a deeper understanding of how AI models can learn from experience. I’ll be adding this project to my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with neural networks, Q-learning algorithms, and AI problem-solving techniques—all valuable skills in the field of computer science.
